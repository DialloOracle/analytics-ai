# What is Streaming Ingest?

## Streaming Ingest

Streaming Ingest provides a fully managed, scalable, and durable solution for ingesting continuous, high-volume streams of data that you can consume and process in real-time. Ingesting events by stream often reduces the impact on the source systems, improves the fidelity of the data (important for data science) and can empower a real-time analytics use case where valuable to the data product owners.

## Streaming Ingest in this workshop

This workshop is to educate users on a Streaming Ingest Data Mesh scenario for IoT. We will examine IoT data that will be used in conjunction with live streaming data to determine if a customer is likely to be a spender, which will trigger events in a Kafka topic to encourage spending. OML models will be created to filter the data in a GGSA environment. Users will learn how to create a pipeline, joining live data and static data from the database to an OML model, Kafka, and OAS. OAS will be used to support analysis on decisions.

In this lab, you will explore an IoT use case using streaming ingest to process real-time IoT data streams of customers to promote events to encourage more spending. You will identify if a customer is likely to be a spender.

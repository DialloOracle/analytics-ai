# What is Integration?

## Integration

Integration is the application of moving data using microservices. Data in motion is typically event-driven. A user action, a device event, a process step or a data store commit can all initiate an event with a data payload. These data payloads are crucial for integrating IoT systems, business processes and databases, data warehouses and data lakes. Using a combination of old and new systems, monoliths and microservices, operational and analytic data stores â€“ a Data Mesh can help to unify these resources across differing business and data domains. This workshop will explore some of the benefits of using event-driven integration to keep data in motion.

## Integration in this workshop

This workshop will show you how events are driving integration for a supply chain scenario. Sensor data is used to track truck maintenance as deliveries are being fulfilled. In addition, weather data and geographic information are used to provide delivery estimates. GoldenGate Microservices Architecture is streaming change data capture for IoT devices, where abnormalities are used to create events. Analytics are used to determine delivery estimates.
